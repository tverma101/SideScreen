# macOS Screen Recording identity incident

Date: 2026-08-21
Scope: local development and private `exp/quality-fork` builds

## Symptom

SideScreen reported that Screen Recording was required even though macOS
displayed SideScreen as granted. Auto-start could also repeat the failure when
an old experiment copy or a rebuilt bundle was launched.

## Evidence captured

- The canonical installed bundle is `/Users/tejas/Applications/SideScreen.app`.
- Its bundle identifier is `com.sidescreen.app` and its designated requirement
  is `identifier "com.sidescreen.app" and info[CFBundleName] = "Side Screen"`.
- The current local build is ad-hoc signed with CDHash
  `941a12f86e2cd968fff08c02c2895e146ade9fb5`.
- The Screen Recording TCC row reported `auth_value=2` for
  `com.sidescreen.app`, but its stored code requirement contained the older
  CDHash `fff4f8fd83a298359fa17ae1365103ed0e69353a`.
- The old experiment bundle was archived at
  `/Users/tejas/vd_campaign/120hz_attack/exp_bin/SideScreenExp.app.legacy-20260821`
  so it cannot be confused with the canonical host. It was moved, not deleted.
- The current host logs its runtime bundle path and skips auto-start when the
  current bundle does not pass `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`.

The visible macOS grant was therefore for an older code identity, not for the
current rebuilt executable. A same-named app in another checkout can produce
the same symptom.

## Durable fix

1. `scripts/install_mac.sh` is the canonical local installer. It copies the
   current root build to `~/Applications/SideScreen.app`, preserves the
   previous bundle as a timestamped `.previous.*` backup, reports the CDHash
   change, and warns when a local ad-hoc rebuild may need a TCC rebind.
2. `AppDelegate` logs the bundle identifier and path at launch, activation,
   and permission checks. `ScreenRecordingPermissionSnapshot` keeps that
   identity attached to the boolean preflight result.
3. The permission card now shows the exact running path and provides Recheck,
   Copy Identity, Request Access, and Open Settings actions. The app refreshes
   the check after returning from System Settings.
4. The ineffective `SideScreen_forceStart` auto-start bypass and the extra
   ScreenCaptureKit request race were removed. Auto-start checks the current
   bundle's permission before starting capture.
5. The explicit local designated requirement is retained for diagnostics, but
   it is not claimed to make an ad-hoc CDHash stable. A real persistent Apple
   signing identity is needed for approval continuity across arbitrary local
   rebuilds.

## Recovery procedure

From the canonical checkout:

```bash
./scripts/build_mac.sh
./scripts/install_mac.sh --launch
```

If the launched canonical bundle still reports Required, open System Settings
-> Privacy & Security -> Screen & System Audio Recording, remove the stale
Side Screen entry, and enable the exact `~/Applications/SideScreen.app` bundle
once. Then quit and relaunch that same bundle. Do not launch
`exp_bin/SideScreenExp.app`, a root build artifact, or a copy from another
checkout while diagnosing permissions.

Verify the identity before reporting a regression:

```bash
codesign -dvvv --verbose=4 ~/Applications/SideScreen.app 2>&1 | rg '^(Identifier|CDHash)='
codesign -d -r- ~/Applications/SideScreen.app 2>&1 | tail -4
```

Do not edit `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` directly and do
not add an automatic `tccutil reset` step. The user-facing System Settings
grant must be bound to the exact canonical bundle after the final build.

## Validation recorded with this incident

- `swift test --disable-sandbox`: 38 tests passed.
- `AndroidClient/gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug --no-daemon`: build
  succeeded; 45 actionable tasks, 1 executed and 44 up-to-date.
- `bash -n scripts/install_mac.sh scripts/build_mac.sh`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- No GitHub Actions workflow files were added or run.

The code and documentation are committed separately from the final human
permission rebind: a macOS user must still approve the exact current bundle in
System Settings before live capture can be called verified.
